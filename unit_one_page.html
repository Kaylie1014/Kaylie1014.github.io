	<h2>Characteristics of Life</h2>
	 <ul>
         <li>Made up of at least one cell</li>
         <li>Can reproduce</li>
         <li>Has DNA</li>
	 <li>Uses energy (metabolism)</li>
	 <li>Responds to stimulus from the environment</li>
	 <li>Grows and develops</li>
	 <li>Maintains homeostasis</li>
	 <li>Evolves (change over time as a group)</li>
	 </ul> 
	<h2>Homeostasis</h2>
	<p>
	   Homeostasis is when an organism maintains a near-constant internal tempreature, normally so that important
	   chemical reactions have the chance to occur.
	</p>
	<h2>Biochemistry</h2>
	<p>
	   Organic molecules contain the element carbon. Important monomers include simple sugars, amino acids,
	   nucleotides, fatty acids, and glycerol. Polymers are composed of monomers. Carbohydrates are composed of simple sugars,
	   proteins are composed of amino acids, lipids are composed of fatty acids and glycerol, and nucleic acids are made up of
	   nucleotides. Two key chemical reactions are Dehydration Synthesis and Hydrolisis. Dehydration synthesis
	   creates polymers out of monomers and removes water. Hydrolysis breaks polymers into monomers and adds water.
	</p>
		<h2> Other Important Info</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li> Enzymes lower the amount of active energy required for a chemical reaction to occur by providing a
				location for it.</li>
			<li> The enzyme and substrates (protein and monomers/polymer) are called an enzyme-substrate complex
				while the reaction is occuring with the help of the enzyme.</li>
			<li> Positive feedback is a response that increases the change happening. Negative feedback stops the
				changes.</li>
