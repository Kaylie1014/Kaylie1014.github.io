		<h2> Meiosis</h2>
		<p>
			Meiosis is the process of creating gametes (sex cells) that occurs in most multicellular organisms.
			Organisms that do not reproduce sexually do not create gametes, and create genetic clones of themselves through
			mitosis. Although asexual reproduction is more efficient, sexual reproduction allows for genetic diversity
			within a species. Genetic diversity means that if a certain strain of a disease infected most of the population,
			not every member ot the species is killed by it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Meiosis involves two nuclear divisions, unlike mitosis. Also separating meiosis from mitosis are the results of
			each process. While mitosis creates two exact, diploid copies of a cell, meiosis creates four haploid gametes.
			This means that meiosis creates cells with only half the genetic material as the rest of the cells. This helps maintain the
			correct number of chromosomes throughout reproductions.
