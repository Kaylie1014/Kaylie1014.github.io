			<h2> DNA and Protein Synthesis</h2>
		
		<h3> Transcription</h3>
		<p>
			Transcription is when mRNA is created based on a section of DNA in the nucleus of the cell. The DNA is
			unzipped, and one of the strands becomes the coding strand. RNA polymerase creates RNA by pairing the correct 
			bases withe the pre-existing ones, only with uracil instead of thymine. Then, the mRNA leaves the nucleus.
			
		</p>
		<h3> Translation</h3>
		<p>
			Translation is when the rRNA reads the mRNA and translates it into amino acids based on the codons (sections
			of three bases.) The rRNA does not start translating the bases until it has read the start codon. There is also
			a stop codon, which tells the rRNA when to stop translating. To find out which codons translate into which amino
			acids, look at the codon chart below.

		<h3> DNA Structure</h3>
		<p>
			DNA is made up of deoxyribose sugars, phosphate groups, and nitrogenous bases. the bases are held together
			with hydrogen bonds, and the phosphates and sugars are connected by covalent bonds. DNA has an easily 
			recognizable double-helix shape, with the bases on the inside. One of the most important parts of 
			DNA structure is the way that bases pair together, called the base-pairing rule. The base-pairing rule states
			that only adenine and thymine can pair together, as well as cytosine and guanine.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			RNA is used to create proteins, and is fairly similar to DNA in some aspects. However, there are some
			key differences.
			<ul>
				<li> RNA is single-stranded</li>
				<li> RNA is made with ribose sugars, not deoxyribose sugars</li>
				<li> RNA cannot contain thymine, so instead, uracil pairs with adenine in its place</li>
			</ul>
			There are three different types of RNA: mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA. mRNA is the copy of a section of DNA used
			as a blueprint for protein creation. rRNA makes up the ribosome, where mRNA is read and translated. tRNA
			brings amino acids to connect to the polymer that the rRNA decodes.
