		<h2> Cells</h2>
		<h3> Eukaryotes vs. Prokaryotes</h3>
		<p> Cells can be separated into two groups- eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The key difference between eukaryotes
			and prokaryotes is that eukaryotes have nuclei and prokaryotes do not. Eukaryotes also tend to be larger than
			prokaryotes, because they contain nuclei and oftentimes, other organelles. Examples of Eukaryotes include: Human
			cells, amoebas, neurons, etc. Most bacteria are prokaryotes.</p>
		
		<h3> Plant cells vs. Animal cells</h3>
		<p> Plant cells and animal cells are visibly different. Plant cells contain certain organelles that animal cells do
			not have. One of the more obvious organelles that they have is the cell wall. The cell wall surrounds the cytoplasm
			of the plant cell, protecting it. Plant cells also have chloroplasts (or chloroplastids,) that can convert 
			sunlight into energy. Finally, plants also have large vacuoles, to store water.
