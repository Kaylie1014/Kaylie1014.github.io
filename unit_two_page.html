		<h2> Cells</h2>
		<p> Cells can be separated into two groups- eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The key difference between eukaryotes
			and prokaryotes is that eukaryotes have nuclei and prokaryotes do not. Eukaryotes also tend to be larger than
			prokaryotes, because they contain nuclei and oftentimes, other organelles. Examples of Eukaryotes include: Human
			cells, amoebas, neurons, etc. Most bacteria are prokaryotes.
